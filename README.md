# To-Do List App


This basic To-Do List app allows users to add items to a list and sort the list by text length and date. The app uses a RecyclerView to display the list of items, and the data is saved using shared preferences.

## <b>Features</b>

* Add items to the To-Do list.

* Sort the list by text length or by date.

* Save and load items using shared preferences.

* Every second item on the list displays a website/picture from the internet/HTML code instead of its name because that was the requirement.

## <b>Setup</b>

* Clone or download the repository.

* Open the project in Android Studio.

* Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## <b>Usage</b>

* Enter the text for a new To-Do item in the input field.

* Click the "Add" button to add the item to the list.

* Use the "Sort by Text Length" and "Sort by Date" buttons to sort the list.

* Exit the app and re-open it to see that the items are saved and loaded correctly.

## <b>Things that are yet to be implemented</b>

* I couldn't figure Task 9B and 9C out. Aaand I kind of think that I may messed up name of first commit or two. Terribly sorry, I am just a young padawan :cowboy_hat_face:.
I tried for many hours to implement a mechanism to hide items with isDeleted = true without UI blanks or crazy app behavior.
* I did my best, and I had a blast doing these tasks. No matter your 'recruitment' outcome, I feel good and blessed because I focused and dedicated tons of my time to my personal developmentand that's always time well spent.
* Thank you for this opportunity and I hope you will find employees you are looking for :grin:. Cheers!
